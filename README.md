# Phishing-Domain-Detection
Used to detect phishing website URLs using ML algorithms.
I have made this project using python language. I have used scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier to classify URLs as safe or malicious.
The features from the url are extracted and passed as a dataframe to the Random Forest Classifier which then classifies it as Safe or Malicious.
The dataset used here can be found here: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/72ptz43s9v/1
